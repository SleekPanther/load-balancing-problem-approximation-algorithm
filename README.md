# Load Balancing Problem Approximation Algorithm
Approximation Algorithm for balancing loads on machines. (Could be applied to processes management on a CPU). Does not guarantee an optimal solution, but instead, the algorithm guarantees that its solution is within a factor of 1.5 of the optimal solution.

## Problem Statement
- `M` identical machines
- `N` jobs
- Each jobs has processing time **T<sub>j</sub>**
- Let `J(i)` be the subset of jobs assigned to machine `i`
- The load of machine `i` is **L<sub>i</sub>** = sum of the processing times for the jobs

**Makespan** = the maximum of the loads on the machines (the machine with the largest load)  
***Goal:* Minimize the Makespan**

## Solution
Assign each job to a machine to minimize makespan  
There are m<sup>n</sup> different assignments of n jobs to m machines, which is **exponential**

**The greedy solution runs in polynomial time and gives a solution no more than 1.5 times the optimal makespan**  
Proof involves complicated sigma notation and can be found in the references

**Sort jobs by largest processing time 1st & keep assigning jobs to the machine with the smallest load**

## Runtime
- O(n log n) for sorting jobs by processing time  
- O(n log m) for Greedy Balance & assigning jobs to machines  
- O(n log n) + O(n log m)  
- **â‡’ O(n log n)**

## Usage
**Machine ID's are meaningless since machines are identical, they're created for readability.  
But the algorithm still creates the job assignments on the machines according to the greedy strategy**  
- `int machineCount` parameter for `balanceMachines()` is how many machines exist in the problem
- `int[][] jobs` is a 2D array containing the jobs
  - `jobs[i]` is an array represents a job
  - `jobs[i][0]` is the **Job Id or name**
  - `jobs[i][1]` is the **Processing time**

## Code Details
- Unlike the pseudocode, this version keeps the jobs assigned to a machine inside the `Machine` object in the Priority Queue
- 1st Creates `M` machines with unique Id's
- Then loop over the jobs and assign the job with the longest processing time to the smallest load machine
  - Java's Priority Queue doesn't really have an `IncreaseKey()` method so the same effect is achieved by removing the machine from the Queue, updating the Machine's `currentLoad` and then adding the Machine back to the Queue
- `Machine` class represents a machine
  - **Some Important Parts of a Machine**
  - `id` is the **id or name of the machine**
  - `currentLoad` is the sum of the processing times of the jobs currently assigned to the machine
  - `jobs` is a 2D ArrayList containing the jobs currently assigned to the machine
  - `Machine` class **overrides** `compareTo()` from the `Comparable` interface so that the `PriotityQueue is always has the smallest load machine at the top
